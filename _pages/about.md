Hi! My name is Maya Chan Morales, I'm a clinical psychology doctoral candidate at the University of Illinois at Chicago working at the Socio-Emotional Teaching and Learning (SETL) Lab with Dr. Kate Zinsser. I am the recipient of the Access to Excellence Fellowship, as well as the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships Program (NSF GRFP). I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2018 with a BA in Psychology and Anthropology, and have since worked as a clinical research coordinator at the Child Brain and Behavior Lab at Stanford, a research assistant at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, and a research assistant at the Stress and Development Lab at Harvard University. My primary research interests are in early life stress, trauma, and adversity in the foster care system, and how these environmental factors can impact a child's neurological and behavioral development, and more specifically, contribute to mental health risks in children and adolescents. In my spare time, I like to read, sing, write poetry, climb, and explore the outdoors!
